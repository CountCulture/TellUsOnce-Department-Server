Dear <%= "#{@submitter['first_name']} #{@submitter['first_name']}" %>

Thank you for the notification of the death of <%= "#{@notification['deceased_first_name']} #{@notification['deceased_family_name']}" %>

We have updated our records accordingly.

You should now register the death at your local registry offices. Here are the ones nearest to you:
<%- @reg_offices.each_with_index do |office, i| -%>
<%= i %>. [approx <%= office['dist_miles'] %> away] <%= office['name'] %>, <%= office['address'] %>, <%= office['url'] %>
<%- end -%>
<%- end -%>


Yours,
